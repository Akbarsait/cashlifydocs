# Categories & Balance Adjustments

> Categories are the foundation of good expense tracking. They allow you to group your transactions and understand your spending habits. Here’s how to manage them. Managing Categories by following these steps will help you organize your finances exactly the way you want and ensure your data is always safe and portable.

## Accessing the Category Manager

1.  Navigate to the **Settings** page from the main sidebar.
2.  Click on the **Categories** tab at the top.
3.  You will now see a list of all your income and expense categories.

## Creating a New Category

1.  Click the round **+** button (Floating Action Button) at the bottom right of the screen.
2.  The "New Category" window will appear.
3.  Fill in the details:
    * **Icon:** Click the icon to choose one that best represents your category.
    * **Category Name:** Give your category a clear name (e.g., "Groceries", "Subscriptions").
    * **Category Type:** Select whether this is for an **Expense** or **Income**.
4.  Set Optional Properties:
    * **Status (Active/Inactive):** Inactive categories won't show up when you're adding a new transaction, which is useful for old categories you no longer use.
    * **Exclude from Totals:** Check this for categories you don't want to include in your dashboard summaries or budget calculations (e.g., reimbursements).
5.  Click **Save**.

## Editing an Existing Category

Simply click on any category in the list. The "Edit Category" window will appear, allowing you to change its name, icon, type, or other properties. Click **Save** when you're done.

## Deleting and Merging Categories

You can manage multiple categories at once using the checkboxes on the left.

1.  **Select Categories:** Check the box next to one or more categories.
2.  **Choose an Action:** Once selected, two buttons will appear at the top of the list:
    * **Merge:** This allows you to combine several categories into one. For example, you could merge "Coffee" and "Restaurants" into "Food & Dining". The app will ask you to choose a target category, and all transactions will be reassigned before the old categories are deleted.
    * **Delete:** This allows you to remove the selected categories.
        * If a category has **no transactions**, it will be permanently deleted.
        * If a category **has transactions**, it will be made **Inactive** to preserve your financial history.

## Reordering Categories

To change the order in which categories appear in dropdown lists, simply click and hold the drag handle (`⋮⋮`) on the left of a category and drag it up or down to your desired position. The order is saved automatically.

## Verify Default Categories:

1.  Log out and **register a new user account**.
2.  Navigate to **Settings → Categories**.
3.  Confirm that the default list ("Food & Dining," "Transport," "Shopping," "Salary," etc.) is now present.
4.  Confirm that the special categories **"Account Transfer"** and **"Balance Adjustment"** are also in the list and appear as non-editable (they cannot be selected or dragged).

## Validate Account Balance Adjustment:

1.  Go to **Settings → Accounts**.
2.  Click on an existing account (e.g., "Main Checking").
3.  The "Balance" field should be read-only. Click the **"Adjust Balance"** button.
4.  Enter a new balance that is **higher** than the current one (e.g., if the balance is $1000, enter $1050).
5.  Click "**Save Adjustment**."
6.  Navigate to the **Transactions** page. You should see a new **income** transaction for $50, automatically categorized as **"Balance Adjustment"**.
7.  Go to the **Dashboard**. Confirm that the "Total Income" and "Total Expenses" cards have **not** changed, as this adjustment is correctly excluded from totals.
8.  Repeat the process with a **lower** balance and verify a new **expense** transaction is created, also with no impact on dashboard totals.
