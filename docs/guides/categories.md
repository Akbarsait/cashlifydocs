## Managing Your Categories

Categories are the foundation of good expense tracking. They allow you to group your transactions and understand your spending habits. Here’s how to manage them.

### Accessing the Category Manager

1.  Navigate to the **Settings** page from the main sidebar.
2.  Click on the **Categories** tab at the top.
3.  You will now see a list of all your income and expense categories.

### Creating a New Category

1.  Click the round **+** button (Floating Action Button) at the bottom right of the screen.
2.  The "New Category" window will appear.
3.  Fill in the details:
    * **Icon:** Click the icon to choose one that best represents your category.
    * **Category Name:** Give your category a clear name (e.g., "Groceries", "Subscriptions").
    * **Category Type:** Select whether this is for an **Expense** or **Income**.
4.  Set Optional Properties:
    * **Status (Active/Inactive):** Inactive categories won't show up when you're adding a new transaction, which is useful for old categories you no longer use.
    * **Exclude from Totals:** Check this for categories you don't want to include in your dashboard summaries or budget calculations (e.g., reimbursements).
5.  Click **Save**.

### Editing an Existing Category

Simply click on any category in the list. The "Edit Category" window will appear, allowing you to change its name, icon, type, or other properties. Click **Save** when you're done.

### Deleting and Merging Categories

You can manage multiple categories at once using the checkboxes on the left.

1.  **Select Categories:** Check the box next to one or more categories.
2.  **Choose an Action:** Once selected, two buttons will appear at the top of the list:
    * **Merge:** This allows you to combine several categories into one. For example, you could merge "Coffee" and "Restaurants" into "Food & Dining". The app will ask you to choose a target category, and all transactions will be reassigned before the old categories are deleted.
    * **Delete:** This allows you to remove the selected categories.
        * If a category has **no transactions**, it will be permanently deleted.
        * If a category **has transactions**, it will be made **Inactive** to preserve your financial history.

### Reordering Categories

To change the order in which categories appear in dropdown lists, simply click and hold the drag handle (`⋮⋮`) on the left of a category and drag it up or down to your desired position. The order is saved automatically.
